# machine-learning-challenge

## Background
The purpose of this project is to discover hidden planets using NASA keplar space telescope data and machine learning in Python. In [exoplanet_data.csv](exoplanet_data.csv), there are various columns of telescope data and more detail description can be found in [the NASA Exoplanet Archieve Website](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html).

The project was done in **Python**, but there are multiple libraries like that **sklearn**, **tensorflow**, **pandas** and **joblib** were used.

## Analysis
Two models were used to compare the results of accuracy of the data.

### 1. First model - sequential model with two layers
